# Project Description:
This project required to develop an js program in order to generate random a password. The html and css file were already provided and my goal was to make the page to interact and respond to the user imputs. 


# My contribution:
I used variables, contitional statemens , and functions in order to make the page to work. 

# Level of Dificulty:
While working on this project i realize how powerful are the functions. Althought I didn't use functions very much in this project, I plan to study in deph this concept and to implement it in my further projects.
